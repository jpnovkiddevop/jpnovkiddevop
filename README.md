- 👋 Hi, I’m john gitonga
- 👀 The marriage between react and django rest framework is superb and the rendering is faster compared to a fully django based app with no react as GUI.
- I enjoy the logic involved in backend/server side the most.
- 🌱 I’m a master of dbms focused with postgres and mongodb database
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are based on software development
- on my free time i enjoy exploring and learning and building machine learning based projects
- currently learning vue js and express js and am enjoying the fact that i can create a fullstack web app using one language.
