- 👋 Hi, I’m John Gitonga
- 👀 The marriage between React and Django rest framework is superb—fast rendering of React UI. Strong authentication, authorization, and messaging in Django make the React Django stack one of the best tech stacks for building web applications that meet different system designs and architectural requirements.
- I enjoy the logic involved in the backend/server-side the most.
- 🌱 I’m a master of dbms focused on Postgres and MongoDB database
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are based on software development
- In my free time I enjoy exploring, learning, and building machine learning-based projects
- I am currently learning Express JS and enjoy creating full-stack web apps using one language(javascript).
